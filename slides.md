Title: Interviewing for Technical Jobs: An informative tail

Abstract:
Over my career I have been on both sides of the interviewing table,
I have accumulated experience being the interviewee most recently and
am going to share my tail of landing a new gig. This will be a retrospective
of my experiences in an effort to prepare others for landing a job
they want.

```

* Ask questions!
* After each interview retrospect

^ * My go to question to ask interviewers: 'What is your least favorite thing about working and company X and what is your favorite thing?'
  * Interviewers share notes, jot down your answers as best you can for different questions you were asked.

# Experiences being interviewer
## The processes I have used
  * Personal
  * Technical (may be combined with personal)
  * Take home code or look at open source projects
  * Team Interview

![full](images/pexels-photo-288477.jpeg)

^ * Personal == Just basic are you a decent person or not
  * Technical == Talk through a few basic areas where we are hiring for, do you seem to have the technical level we are looking for
  * Take home project or looking at your code, this depends on do you have something out there for me to verify your technical skills
  * Lastly have you talk to the team and see if they would enjoy working with you

# General Tips - IMHO
* Always send follow up communication
* Communicate your timeline, and ask theirs
* Research the company before interviewing
* Make sure your contact information is correct and professional

![full](images/pexels-photo.jpg)

^ * Communicate and thank the folks you talked with, get their email addresses and send a short message. Even if you don't want to continue the process, make sure to write something sincere and personal. I loved getting these notes later in the day or the next morning. It put the person back in the front of my mind.
  * It can be helpful for you and them to have a timeline communicated up front.
