Title: Interviewing for Technical Jobs: An informative tail

Abstract:
Over my career I have been on both sides of the interviewing table,
I have accumulated experience being the interviewee most recently and
am going to share my tail of landing a new gig. This will be a retrospective
of my experiences in an effort to prepare others for landing a job
they want.
