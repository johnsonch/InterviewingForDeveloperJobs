## Experiences being interviewee at 5 different companies

## Company A
### Process
* Contacted by 3rd party recruiter
* Phone conversation with upper management
* Technical interview with developer
* Phone conversation with CEO
* Follow up with upper management

^ * Was given some code to evaluate as if I was looking at a pull request
  * The company was smaller and not great at hiring, it was a very scattered process to some extent. I asked about the process up front and basically got the first 3 items.

## Company A
### What I learned

* As the interview processes progressed to continue doing research about the company

## Company B
### Process
* Sent in application via their online submission platform
* Received a code test to complete
* Code was reviewed and then was granted a first round video interview
  * The two folks that interviewed me had a script and took turns asking questions. They both took notes.


^ The first interview they explained to me that this company has a entire set of questions and a rating matrix. They said they only got my first name and did not get my resume or cover letter
